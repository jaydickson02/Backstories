        <p class="mt-4">
          27 years prior to the current day sat a forest clearing teaming with beauty and the purest form of nature. This place represented a heart of the natural world. One of the many points across the lands in which all things that grow draw from to enable life and the deep mythical connection that comes with it.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Pursued to this place was a young woman who was tormented by her wicked father. He who sought to take her life just as he had taken her mother's. He had discovered this daughter to be the product of an affair and in his rage and fury slaughtered his wife and thought of nothing but doing the same to his daughter.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Discovering his intentions she ran fast to the forest near their village and fled for days deep into its heart being followed all along by her relentless father. Whether by chance or because she felt drawn to the place - she came upon the beautiful clearing that seemed to emit a strong natural power. It was here that she collapsed in exhaustion. But she knew her father would soon arrive to exact his cruel revenge.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          She had been unprepared when entering these woods but he was a revered tracker and a man of focus. It was only a matter of time. But she had no energy to spare for a fight or to continue running. All she could do now was lie there and await her fate.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Before long he came upon the place where she lie weak and vulnerable. But unbeknownst to him this place was not all it seemed. Lifting her head from the ground he placed a knife to her neck and slit her throat. Ending his tyrannical pursuit of her. But this act of unspeakable horror committed in a place of such purity and peace would not go unpunished.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The clearing seemed to tremor in a kind of fury as the plants moved contorted and shook. It was as though the place was screaming with a kind of pain. Vines sprung from the earth and covered the man. Dragging and crushing his body into the earth. His blood doused the clearing and his body was mulched into it. Slowly the place returned to its quiet and still state. But the horrors of what had happened here lingered as a kind of wound on this place - a wound that needed healing.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The corpse of the young woman laid in the clearing splattered in blood belonging both to herself and her murderous father. Nature it seems works in mysterious ways. In this place that had known nothing of death and everything of life - two souls had been lost. So this place did what it always does. It sought to grow something new. Something to replace what was lost.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          And so slowly over many months from her corpse grew branches as strong as bone that themselves became covered by tissues as supple as the leaves and these tissues were filled with a blood that flowed as briskly as the water in a stream.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          These structures curved and joined together until one day two small creatures unmistakably human awoke in the clearing and began to cry. The balance had been restored. Two twins had been born of three parents and inherited their traits: from nature they were blessed with knowledge wisdom and goodness the daughter gave them a deep understanding of love pain and patience and finally from the father came skill and determination but also the capacity for rage.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          So a set of fraternal twins one boy and one girl had been born. They grew in the forest and were nannied by the creatures that lived there. For this reason amongst others they not only had a unique bond with both each other but also the very soul of nature itself and so understood and connected deeply with all things natural. The children had little need to stray from the forest center and as such had no interaction with the outside world. But all that would soon change.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          One night the boy awoke on the forest floor with a jolt and found his sister to be missing. He searched for many days in the forest but could find no trace of her. Feeling alone for the first time in his life he was determined to find her and so he left his familiar home and set off into the greater world in search of his lost sister.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          He learned quickly how to survive in this brutal new world. Finding himself to be a natural with weapons especially the sword and with the magic of nature. He made his way nomadically from settlement to settlement offering protection and trading game for favours and currency. All the while gathering information and hints that could help him on his quest to find his lost sister.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
        This information that he had gathered for the past 17 years all seemed led him to one place. The Worldwound.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
        For this reason Noctua now found himself at the city of Kenabras joining the ranks of the fifth crusade. Hoping the answers he seeks lie within the borders of the deadly Worldwound.
