<h2 class="section-title">Backstory</h2>
<p class="mt-4">Emillin was born in the secluded village of Eldhaven, nestled deep within the Ashenwood Forest. Known for its rich arcane history, Eldhaven was a place where magic intertwined with daily life. From a young age, Emillin exhibited a strong intellect and curiosity about the world beyond her village. She learned the basics of alchemy and herbology from the elders, but her aspirations stretched far beyond Eldhaven’s borders.</p>

<p class="mt-4">The arcane energies that permeated Eldhaven made it a focal point for many who sought knowledge and power. Emillin, drawn to the mysteries of the arcane, often wandered the ancient ruins scattered throughout the forest, believing that they held secrets yet to be found.</p>

<h2 class="text-l font-semibold mt-4">Veylan</h2>
<p class="mt-4">That all changed when she met Veylan, a stranger who claimed to be a scholar fleeing from a demonic threat. His tales of ancient magic and hidden dangers intrigued Emillin, drawing her into his world of secrets.</p>

<p class="mt-4">Veylan embodied the mystery and intelligence she longed for, but his intentions were far from noble. Under the guise of seeking protection, he showed Emillin terrifying visions to manipulate her into signing a contract. In her desperation to save him, she agreed, unaware of the true nature of the deal she had struck.</p>

<p class="mt-4">The contract bound Emillin to Veylan’s service, at which point he revealed himself to be the very devil he had claimed to fear. Tricked into 100 years of bondage, Veylan used her as his tool, sending her deep into the dangerous dungeons beneath Avalice to retrieve powerful artifacts and gather arcane knowledge. He enhanced her body with dark magic, giving her the strength, powers, and resilience needed to survive the perilous depths. Over the years, this dark influence twisted her, transforming her into a Tiefling with fiery powers—a far cry from the hopeful young woman she once was.</p>

<h2 class="text-l font-semibold mt-4">Vengeance</h2>
<p class="mt-4">Free at last, Emillin sought vengeance against Veylan, hunting him through the very dungeons where she had once served him. However, without the full extent of the powers he had bestowed upon her, she found herself severely unequipped to confront him, let alone approach the depths at which he operated.</p>

<p class="mt-4">But she could feel that her abilities, though highly diminished, were still present in some form or another, and she worked tirelessly to hone them. She joined adventuring parties that delved into the dungeons in a bid to gain the support she needed to survive down there. In exchange for their strength, she offered her knowledge of the dungeons’ workings.</p>

<p class="mt-4">As she journeyed with these adventurers, witnessing their struggles and the fragility of life in the dungeons, Emillin began to question the path she was on. The rage that had driven her started to fade, replaced by a growing empathy for those around her.</p>

<p class="mt-4">Accepting that vengeance would not bring peace, Emillin turned her efforts toward rebuilding her life. She joined the Pathfinders Guild, offering her expertise to new generations of Delvers. No longer driven by rage, Emillin now seeks to explore the world, recover lost knowledge, and protect those who cannot defend themselves.</p>

<h2 class="text-l font-semibold mt-4">Current Situation</h2>
<p class="mt-4">Now residing in Stormreach, Emillin spends her days at the Pathfinders Guild, where she trains and mentors new adventurers preparing to delve into the Labyrinth. She spends much of her time honing her pyromantic abilities, ensuring she remains sharp for any challenges that might arise within the dungeons.</p>

<p class="mt-4">In her free time, Emillin can be found wandering the markets of Stormreach, forging connections with merchants and traders who deal in rare arcane goods. Though still haunted by her past, she has found a semblance of peace in her new life, surrounded by allies who share her desire to uncover the truth buried deep within Avalice’s most dangerous dungeons.</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
  <li>Common</li>
  <li>Infernal</li>
  <li>Abyssal</li>
  <li>Undercommon</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-l font-semibold mt-4">Goals</h2>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
  <li><strong>Rebuild her life:</strong> She seeks to reclaim the years lost to Veylan’s deceit by exploring the world with a fresh and positive perspective, experiencing all it has to offer.</li>
  <li><strong>Forge strong relationships:</strong> After the trials of the last 100 years, and long since losing everyone she knew before, she is determined to find solace in good company and people who can help her learn to trust again.</li>
  <li><strong>Explore her powers:</strong> Under Veylan’s control, her powers and body were enhanced. Now free from him, her abilities are but a remnant of what they had been. However, they seem to be growing, and she seeks to discover how far she can push her abilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Help and guide:</strong> Her experiences have given her a deep sense of responsibility to protect those who cannot protect themselves, especially from forces like Veylan. She offers guidance to many seeking to delve into the dungeons and shares her knowledge with adventurers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-l font-semibold mt-4">Relationships</h2>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
  <li><strong>Pathfinders Guild:</strong> Emillin’s new community, where she mentors novice Delvers and finds renewed purpose in guiding others away from the dark path she once walked.</li>
  <li><strong>Veylan:</strong> Once the object of Emillin’s trust and affection, Veylan deceived her into a century of servitude. Now, he is the target of her past vengeance and the source of her transformation.</li>
  <li><strong>The Otherlings:</strong> Bonded through shared trauma, these are those who served sentences alongside Emillin. Many had been tricked into sentences lasting thousands of years, and she had left them behind. Others had escaped before her time was up and may now roam free in the world.</li>
