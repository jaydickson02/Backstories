        <h2 class="section-title">Backstory</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Emmi, an Eladrin shaman, was born from the life essence of an ancient forest, tied intricately to a small oak sapling. For as long as she could remember, she had been one with nature, feeling every breath of the wind, every rustle of the leaves, and every pulse of life that coursed through the forest. Her spirit was young, having only existed for two years, but her connection to the land gave her wisdom far beyond her years.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The harmony of her life was shattered when the Worldwound—a monstrous tear in reality itself—began to expand, threatening to consume her beloved home. As the demonic influence spread, corrupting everything it touched, Emmi felt an unimaginable terror. The forest trembled, its creatures fled, and the once vibrant land began to wither under the encroaching shadow.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          As the abyssal forces drew near, Emmi, desperate to save herself and her cherished forest, called out for help. Her cries were answered by a crusader, a lone adventurer who stumbled upon her grove while seeking a way to combat the growing evil. Emmi, her voice trembling with fear and hope, begged the crusader to save her, to rescue her from the impending doom.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The crusader, moved by her plight and the purity of her spirit, agreed to help. With great care, he dug up the small oak sapling to which Emmi was bound, knowing that separating her from this connection would mean her end. As he lifted the sapling, a small entourage of spirits appeared—beings who had watched over Emmi since she was a mere seedling. These spirits, ancient protectors of the forest, agreed to follow and aid Emmi in her journey, imbuing her with their strength and wisdom.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Now, Emmi travels with the crusader and her spirit companions, a living embodiment of nature's resilience. She is on a mission to fight back against the Worldwound, seeking to reclaim and restore her home. However, her journey is not without its challenges. Bound to her sapling, Emmi is unable to move on her own and relies entirely on the kindness and strength of others to carry her forward. The spirits, her eternal guardians, enable her to harness the power of the natural world, allowing her to take on the form of great beasts when needed.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Despite her dependence, Emmi's resolve is unshakable. She has grown weary of those who seek only to harm and destroy, her heart aching for the peace her forest once knew. Her journey is as much a quest for healing as it is a battle against the demonic forces. Through her, the ancient spirits of the forest fight back, and she dreams of a day when her home will once again be a sanctuary of life and beauty.

        <h2 class="section-title">Traits</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li><strong>Somewhat reckless and naive:</strong> Emmi's young spirit often leads her into trouble as she navigates the complexities of the world outside her forest.</li>
          <li><strong>Awestruck by the world:</strong> Everything beyond her grove is new and wondrous to her, filling her with a childlike wonder and curiosity.</li>
          <li><strong>Chaotic Good:</strong> She is driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect all living things, yet she struggles with understanding the nuances of morality in the wider world.</li>
          <li><strong>Love for all living things:</strong> Emmi has a profound respect and affection for life, but her encounters with malice have made her wary of creatures that seek only to harm.</li>
          <li><strong>Desperate to restore her home:</strong> Above all, Emmi yearns to see her forest free from the taint of the Worldwound, dreaming of the day it will flourish once more.</li>
