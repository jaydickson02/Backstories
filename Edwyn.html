      <p>
        Edwyn was a knight of Cyre with royal blood, born to parents Elsana and Robeyrt. His mother, a wood elf, was a vestigial member of the old elven society that had settled in Cyre, now long ruled by a human-dominated monarchy. Though some ill will still stirred within the elven population, most were complacent and happy with their lives.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Robeyrt promoted his marriage to Elsana to the king as a way to ease tensions with the elven population, though his own motives were much more innocent. He had fallen inexplicably in love with Elsana. With the king's blessing, they had two children, heirs not to the throne but to the Cyrian estate of Freywood. It was here that Edwyn and his younger brother Georgie grew up.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        As they aged, the people of Freywood grew to admire the youths. They were respectful, kind, and modest, albeit somewhat out of touch with the realities of the world, as was expected of nobility.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Edwyn was immensely fond of his younger brother. Georgie had a unique way of seeing the world, always finding something to marvel at in the ordinary. His innocence and genuine enthusiasm for life brought a sense of lightness to Edwyn's days. Whenever Edwyn felt burdened by his responsibilities or the harsh realities of the world, Georgie would say something delightfully unexpected that lifted his spirits. His laughter was contagious, and his heart was pure.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Upon entering young adulthood, Edwyn offered his sword to the king and was knighted, as was his duty. As part of his responsibilities, he often visited the men fighting on the front lines, a move the king believed would bolster the troops and show that their king had not forsaken them.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Of course, the king and his immediate family would need to remain safe, far from the battle, as risking their lives was too great a danger.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        As the war went on, Edwyn noticed that Georgie was feeling its effects. Their parents were distracted with the war effort, and Edwyn was often away attending to his duties.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Hoping to improve his brother's mood, Edwyn proposed taking Georgie with him on his next journey to the front.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Upon their arrival at the front, Edwyn left Georgie to settle in at the barracks while he attended a meeting with the general. Not an hour had passed before screams erupted from the edge of town. Edwyn rushed out to the street and saw a horrific mist, the height of a mountain, emblazoned with giant tormented faces. The misty wall was a distance away, but its shallow fog had encroached into the town, covering the area where he knew the barracks to be.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Edwyn sped through the streets as people around him ran in the opposite direction. Many were coughing, and some collapsed around him, but he could not stop for them. He sought just one face. Nearing the barracks, he began to yell for his brother, but the mist affected him too. His throat felt full of razors, and he coughed where he stood, blood splattering to the ground at his feet. He screamed for his brother between fits, but no answer came. He stumbled forward and collided with a body on the ground. It was Georgie. His front was dressed with scarlet blood, and he did not seem to be moving. With a mighty effort, Edwyn heaved his brother over his shoulders and stumbled back along the street. The fog seemed never-ending, and his coughing fits nearly brought him to his knees. But he kept going, he had to get Georgie out of there.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        After what felt like a lifetime, they breached the mist, breathing fresh air again. Edwyn drew on the very last of his strength to dash through the town, dropping to his knees at the stable. His last memory was of the general shouting, “Stent, Reven, mount them to your horses now! We need to get out of here!”
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Edwyn awoke on the hard ground. Opening his eyes, he saw men in similar positions, some still as the grave, others groaning and moaning. Like a bolt of energy, he remembered: Georgie. He shot upright, dizziness clanging in his skull, but he did not falter. Looking to his right, he saw him. The small body of his brother lay still on the ground, nothing but a thin bit of cloth between him and the earth. Edwyn crawled to his side. Georgie felt cold and clammy. His breath was raspy and shallow. A man came running over.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 quote">
        “My lord, please, you must rest. It is a miracle you are up at all!”
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 quote">
        “My brother, is he alright? What are you doing for him?” Edwyn choked back at him.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 quote">
        “My lord, his injuries are severe. I am afraid he will not be long for this world. We spared what medicine we had to treat you and the soldiers.”
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 quote">
        “You did what?!” Edwyn's yell was hoarse, and the taste of blood renewed itself in his mouth. “My brother… he is to be given. Given…” Edwyn could feel his consciousness waning. “Please, my brother… please.” And he was taken by the effort and dropped back to the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Perhaps it was fate, perhaps he had sensed it, but when Edwyn's eyes opened again, they fell on Georgie, and he could hear the rattling gasps now emanating from his brother. He dragged himself to his body. He tried to yell for help, but he simply could not speak; his torn-up throat was unusable. He looked at his brother as he began to convulse upon the floor. He was powerless to help, no voice, no strength, no hope. Blood spluttered from Georgie's mouth before he fell completely limp and silent. Lost forever.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Edwyn felt a burning pain surge through him, a rage, a darkness. It filled him entirely, and a guttural scream emanated from his torn-up throat, and then, there was light. So much light. It swallowed the darkness, it purged the rage, but it emboldened the pain. The light spoke to him, not with words, but he could feel it urging him, guiding him to find the message within himself.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 quote">
        “Use this pain, hold onto it. Let it guide you to protect. You have felt true darkness; only with that context can you now understand the extent of the power of the light. Be my sword, and I will ensure you will never be powerless again.” He gasped a breath and felt reborn. One thought surged through his mind: “Never again.”
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Over the coming months, Edwyn channeled his mourning into helping others. Messages began coming into the makeshift camp, indicating that much of Cyre had suffered a similar fate. Reports of entire cities dying with barely a survivor to note the loss fanned the fire now burning inside him. He had no word of his parents, no word of the king. As soon as he was able, he ventured to the outreaches where he had last heard Prince Oargev was training with the king's guard. He hoped that this region was far enough away to have spared him. The trip was perilous, but he found the prince, alone and in bad health but alive. Edwyn protected him on their trip back to the camp. There, at Edwyn's urging, the prince claimed command of the camp and began their retreat into Breeland, where he began negotiating with King Boranel.
